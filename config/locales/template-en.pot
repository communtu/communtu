In order to get the bundle rated and commented you need to publish your bundle. Attention: publish a bundle only if you are sure it will not be changed in the near future! Editing the bundle when it is published is not possible.<p> If you think that a programs fits into one of your bundles you can edit it (assuming it is not published).
