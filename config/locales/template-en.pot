Now you have to enter a meaningful name for your bundle, state the version of your bundle and provide a description so that other users will know what your bundle is about. In order to get the bundle rated and commented you need to publish your bundle. Attention: publish a bundle only if you are sure it will not be changed in the near future! Editing the bundle when it is published is not possible.<p> If you think that a programs fits into one of your bundles you can edit it (assuming it is not published). To do this go to <b>Bundle</b> and then to \"My bundles\". Click on the bundle you want to edit. Choose \"Edit package list\" from the dropdown list on the right side.
