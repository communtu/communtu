With a click on "change" you can change the GUI (Kubuntu (KDE, Xubuntu (XFCE) or Lubuntu (LXDE) in use and what software sources and licences shall be installed. After clicking on "Save" you will need to click on <b>Download</b> again to get back to the software selection page.<p> You can now make a rough selection of the software you want to install, according to the tasks you want to perform with your computer (e. g. editing graphics). When a category is chosen a list of published bundles will appear on the right side. When a bundle is marked as "Installed by default" it will be preselected. Every change you make is saved immediately. With a click on "Install" you can install the selected bundles on your computer. If not already done, you need to install the software sources first.<p> The second way of installing with Communtu is by installing a bundle directly. To do so, click on <b>Bundle</b> and next on <b>All published bundles</b>. You now see a overview of all published bundles in Communtu sorted by the name. Again, if not already done you need to install the sources (a click on "Add sources" should do the trick) and with a click on "Install through meta-package" will install the bundle on your computer.

Now you have to enter a meaningful name for your bundle, state the version of your bundle and provide a description so that other users will know what your bundle is about. In order to get the bundle rated and commented you need to publish your bundle. Attention: publish a bundle only if you are sure it will not be changed in the near future! Editing the bundle when it is published is not possible.<p> If you think that a programs fits into one of your bundles you can edit it (assuming it is not published). To do this go to <b>Bundle</b> and then to \"My bundles\". Click on the bundle you want to edit. Choose \"Edit package list\" from the dropdown list on the right side.
