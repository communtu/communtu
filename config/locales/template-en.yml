  view_home_faq_04: There are two ways to install a bundle.<p> The first way is to click on <b>Download</b>. You will now be presented a small formular in which you can choose the tasks you want to perform with your computer. Next you have to choose which version of Ubuntu you want to use (in most cases it will be detected correctly and you only have to pick it from the list) and which GUI you use (Gnome = Ubuntu, KDE = Kubuntu, XFCE = Xubuntu). The last two steps are about the license and the security of the progams (which sources you want to be added and if the programs shall be open or closed source). You can now click on "Save rough selection and install" to get to the end and install the preselected bundles or you can click on "Save rough selection" to make a more detailed choice of the bundles being installed. Finally you need to add the Communtu sources to your system and, when this is finished, you only have to click on "Install" and the chosen bundles will be installed.<p> The second way is to click on <b>Bundle</b> and then on "Published bundles". You now see a list with every bundle created in Communtu. Here you can install a bundle directly with a click on "Install through metapackage", assuming you have added the sources earlier. If not, a click on "Add sources" will add them to your system.

Now you have to enter a meaningful name for your bundle, state the version of your bundle and provide a description so that other users will know what your bundle is about. In order to get the bundle rated and commented you need to publish your bundle. Attention: publish a bundle only if you are sure it will not be changed in the near future! Editing the bundle when it is published is not possible.<p> If you think that a programs fits into one of your bundles you can edit it (assuming it is not published). To do this go to <b>Bundle</b> and then to \"My bundles\". Click on the bundle you want to edit. Choose \"Edit package list\" from the dropdown list on the right side. Now you're in the bundle editor again. When finished changing your package list it needs to be saved. Raise the version number and save the bundle. It is now updated."

  livecd_message: With the Live-CD you can test the software you have chosen and install the system with the previous made software choice. For this, an ISO-file ({{cdimage_link}}) is created which you can burn. You need an empty CD-R or, if you have chosen lots of software, an empty DVD-R.<br /><br />The creation of the image takes a while. You will be informed automatically when your image has been created. For this, a valid e-mail address is required to be entered in your profile.
