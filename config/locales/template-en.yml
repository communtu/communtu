When a category is chosen a list of published bundles will appear on the right side. When a bundle is marked as "Installed by default" it will be preselected. Every change you make is saved immediately. With a click on "Install" you can install the selected bundles on your computer. If not already done, you need to install the software sources first.<p> The second way of installing with Communtu is by installing a bundle directly. To do so, click on <b>Bundle</b> and next on <b>All published bundles</b>. You now see a overview of all published bundles in Communtu sorted by the name. Again, if not already done you need to install the sources (a click on "Add sources" should do the trick) and with a click on "Install through meta-package" will install the bundle on your computer.
