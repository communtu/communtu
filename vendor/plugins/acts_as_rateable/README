Acts As Rateble
=============

Acts_as_rateable is a plugin released under the MIT license. 
It makes activerecord models rateable through a polymorphic association and optionally logs which user rated which model.
In this case, one user can rate an object once. Used on cotcot.hu for article rating, sponsored quizzes, etc.


Example
=======

Install the plugin into your vendor/plugins directory, insert 'acts_as_rateable' into your model, then restart your application.

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base

	acts_as_rateable
	
end

Now your model is extended by the plugin, you can rate it ( 1-# )or calculate the average rating.

@post.rate_it( 4, current_user.id )

@post.average_rating #=> 4.0

@post.average_rating_round #=> 4

@post.average_rating_percent #=> 80

@post.rated_by?( current_user ) #=> rating || false

Post.find_average_of( 4 ) #=> array of posts

See acts_as_rateable.rb for further details!
